# Newton's forward interpolation
   Summary of Steps• 
   Step 1: Develop a general Taylor series expansion for f(x) about x0    
   .• Step 2: Express the various order forward differences at x0 in terms of  and itsderivatives evaluated at f(x).
   This will allow us to express the actual derivatives eval-uated at x0 in terms of forward differences.• 
   Step 3: Using the general Taylor series expansion developed in Step 1,
   sequentiallysubstitute in for the derivatives evaluated at x0 in terms of forward differences (i.e.substitute in the expressions developed in Step 2).
